## Prerequisites

- An active account ([learn more](/get-started/setup))

## Steps

Start by going to the series page at [qiton.app/series](https://qiton.app/series).

In order to make your experience smooth, we provide you with a beautiful list containing the latest scrims and officials.
When a new match ends, these data can take up to one hour to update.

<Frame>
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="./images/matches/list.png"
        alt="Matches list"
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="./images/matches/list.png"
        alt="Matches list"
    />
</Frame>

## Filters

For now, you can only filter by match type (official or scrim) and by team name.
More parameters will come soon!
