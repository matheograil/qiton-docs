## Prerequisites

- An active account ([learn more](/get-started/setup))

## Success rate

Our system is designed to import your last 100 matches from GRID.GG hourly. Sometimes errors can occur due to various reasons.
That's why we have a settings section to show you how many matches were successfully imported.

Please go to the settings page [here](https://qiton.app/settings). You will see some statistics like:

<Frame>
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="./images/import-rate/statistics.png"
        alt="How many matches and scrims are imported"
    />
    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="./images/import-rate/statistics.png"
        alt="How many matches and scrims are imported"
    />
</Frame>

- **detected**: The number of matches that were detected by our system. It includes both successful and failed matches.
- **processed**: The number of matches that were processed successfully by our system.
- **pending or failed**: The number of matches that were not processed. It includes both pending and failed matches.
- **success rate**: Simple percentage.

## Why my success rate is low?

Usually it means that our system is currently processing your matches. Please wait a few hours and refresh the page.
If the success rate is still low, please [contact us](/miscellaneous/support).
