As Qiton is still in development, we are aware of some issues and limitations that we have.

## Last 50 matches
When a new account is delivered, we import the last 50 matches from GRID.GG.
So if your team played more than 50 matches during onboarding, only the last 50 matches will be imported.

## Total matches limit

Stored matches take a lot of space. We are currently working on a limit per account which could be increased by contacting us.
By default, the limit is set to 200 matches per account. Obviously the oldest matches will be deleted first.
